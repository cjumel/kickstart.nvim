-- lsp_signature.nvim

-- Show function signature as you type.
--
-- This plugins provide 2 features I found useful, compared to the Noice alternative I used previously: it supports out
-- of the box live signature help as you type, whereas in Noice it disappears as soon as you start typing, and the
-- virtual text hint brings information on the current parameter, including its docstring, which is super convenient
-- when they are many parameters or a long docstring.
