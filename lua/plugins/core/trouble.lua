-- Trouble
--
-- Trouble provides pretty lists for showing diagnostics, references, telescope results, quickfix lists, etc.,
-- to help you solve all the trouble your code is causing. It is a very nice interface for very various stuff, quite
-- complementary with Telescope and other plugins using the quickfix and loclist lists.
