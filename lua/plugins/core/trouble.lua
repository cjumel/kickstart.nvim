-- Trouble
--
-- Trouble provides pretty lists for showing diagnostics, references, telescope results, quickfix lists, etc., to help
-- you solve all the trouble your code is causing. With a very cool user interface and the integratation of many other
-- tools (like the Todo comments plugins), it is very complementary with plugins like Telescope, since Telescope shines
-- with fuzzy searching and for "one-time" navigation (once we select entries, the Telescope menu disappears), while
-- Trouble is better equipped for long-term navigation of items (we can select an item while keeping the Trouble window
-- open).
