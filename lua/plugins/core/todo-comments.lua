-- Todo Comments
--
-- Todo Comments is a plugin to highlight, list and search todo-comments (`TODO`, `HACK`, `BUG`, etc.), in your
-- projects. It is very convenient to document directly in the code base the next steps to do, long-term issues left for
-- the future like unresolved bugs or performance issues, etc. Besides, it is very nicely integrated with other plugins,
-- like Telescope, Trouble, or code snippets, to define custom todo-comment snippets.

    -- Add "NOW" as a custom keyword for stuff to do right now. This makes possible to add and and display only the
    --  todo-comments added for the current task at hand, while not being polluted by the long-term todo-comments,
    --  which may not be related to it. NOW todo-comments are designed as an alternative to TODO (with the same icon
    --  & color), but which should not be shared in any way.
    keywords = { NOW = { icon = "ï€Œ ", color = "info" } },
